This project provides the facility of packing and unpacking the regular files.
In the case of packing activity, all the data of multiple regular files gets stored file with all related metadata.
In the case of unpacking activity, the data from the packed file gets extracted in a separate file with all necessary details.
To maintain the security of the data we provide encryption and decryption techniques.
