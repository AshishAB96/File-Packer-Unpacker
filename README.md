# File-Packer-Unpacker
This project enables packing and unpacking of regular files. Packing combines multiple files into one with metadata, while unpacking extracts them separately. It includes encryption/decryption for data security and offers a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for seamless interaction with the application.
